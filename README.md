# TIKdevil

Fastest batch TIKs (eShop TIcKets) maker and installer on the planet, right on your 3DS!

# Features
- Doesn't anymore rely on encTitleKeys.bin nor any files, direct table parse from that title key site;
- **Complete revamp, 1 click take-them-all in less than 5 minutes**;
- **Reads already installed tickets and only generates missing ones**;
- **Direct installs generated tickets!**
- Removes temp files, leaving only table for local storage.

**Soon**
- Region filtering; (partially implemented)
- Separate menu items for single things;
- QR to CIA for quick installing and updating TIKdevil;
- **eShop redirection**;
- More speeding and stuff :smile_cat: 

# Building
LibCTRU v.1.1.0 or higher is required. The latest release can be found at https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib/releases/latest

The bt folder contains buildtools for the 3ds, up to date as of the 16th of May 2017.

The code in my fork has been modified to compile with a standard devkitPro Windows environment, excepting changes above. Run make and magic happens.
